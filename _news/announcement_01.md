I'm thrilled to announce that two of my submissions to AAAI 2024 have been accepted. The paper titled "[Learning to Follow: Lifelong Multi-agent Pathfinding with Decentralized Replanning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01207)" will be presented as an **oral** presentation, and the paper "[Decentralized Monte Carlo Tree Search for Partially Observable Multi-agent Pathfinding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15908)" will be showcased in a poster session.
