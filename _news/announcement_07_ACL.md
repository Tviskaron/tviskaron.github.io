Excited to have our paper "CrafText Benchmark: Advancing Instruction Following in Complex Multimodal Open-Ended World" in the Main Track at ACL 2025 in Vienna!

We introduce CrafText, a new benchmark and environment for multimodal RL, designed to tackle instruction following in complex, dynamic settings. The paper also proposes several strong baselines to drive progress in this area.
