I'm excited to announce our recent preprint titled *MAPF-GPT*, a GPT-like model designed for MAPF problems. 
It is trained using pure imitation learning on trajectories generated by LaCAM. 
MAPF-GPT performs exceptionally well on unseen instances and outperforms state-of-the-art learnable solvers such as SCRIMP and DCC.

Here are the links to the [preprint on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00134) and the [open-source code](https://github.com/Cognitive-AI-Systems/MAPF-GPT).
