Iâ€™m happy to announce that our paper, MAPF-GPT: Imitation Learning for Multi-Agent Pathfinding at Scale, has been accepted to the AAAI 2025 Conference!

Here are the links to the [preprint on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00134) and the [open-source code](https://github.com/CognitiveAISystems/MAPF-GPT).
