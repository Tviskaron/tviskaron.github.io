As a Research Scientist with a PhD in Computer Science, my expertise centers on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, particularly in the realms of applied Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Systems. My work includes developing advanced RL algorithms and exploring the synergy between Planning and Learning. Notably, I've developed several state-of-the-art methods for decentralized multi-agent pathfinding, including [Follower](https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/learn-to-follow), [MATS-LP](https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/mats-lp), [Switcher](https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/when-to-switch), and the [POGEMA environment](https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/pogema) for evaluating these methods. 

My contributions to hierarchical RL, particularly within embodied environments such as Minecraft, were highlighted by the [ForgER](https://sites.google.com/view/forgetful-experience-replay) approach that secured first place in the NeurIPS 2019 MineRL Diamond competition. 

Furthermore, I've been leading efforts to combine Natural Language Processing (NLP) with RL to improve language-driven task solving, highlighted by my role in directing the RL track of the [IGLU competition](https://www.iglu-contest.net/) at NeurIPS 2021/2022.
